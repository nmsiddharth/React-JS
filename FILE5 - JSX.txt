JSX - Javascript XML

        1. JSX - Syntax extension for Javascript.
        2. We can write Markup inside the JS file.
        3. We will have a function which will return method.
            Inside the return
                => We will write our Markup/HTML
        4. We will use the curly braces to define variables inside the Markup.
        5. We can use variables inside the JSX -> using the {}.
        6. VERY VERY Important
                => return statement -> NEVER return more than ONE element.
                                    -> If we want multiple elements, then wrap them in another parent element.
        7. We can use Objects and map their value inside the Markup.
        8. We can call functions and pass parameters to the function inside the Markup.
