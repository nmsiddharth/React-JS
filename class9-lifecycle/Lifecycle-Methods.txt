REACT LIFECYCLE METHODS
    -> A components lifecycle has 3 main phases:
        1). Mounting phase
            => The mounting phase refers to the period when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
        2). Updating phase
            => This phase occurs when a component's props or state changes, and the component needs to be updated in the DOM.
        3). Unmounting phase
            => The Unmounting phase refers to the lifecycle stage when a component is being removed from the DOM and is no longer rendered or accessible.

    -> These methods allow you to control the component's behaviour and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.    

MOUNTING PHASE METHODS
    1). constructor() :
        -> This method is called when component is first created.
        -> The constructor is called when an instance of components is being created.
        -> You can use it to initialize state and bind event handlers.    

    2). render() :
        -> This method returns the HTML that should be rendered for this component.
        -> The render() is responsible for generating component's virtual DOM representation based on its current props and state.
        -> it is called everytime the component needs to be re-rendered, either because its props or state have changed, or because a parent component has been re-rendered. 

    3). componentWillMount() :
            // Presently they are removed. It exist upto react 16v.
             
        ->
